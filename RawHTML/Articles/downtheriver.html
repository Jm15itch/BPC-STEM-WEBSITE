    <h2 style="padding-top:20px;">STEAM</h2>
    <p>As of writing, BPC has a growing ICT group which is expected to become an official thursday extracurricular very soon, I'm excited to see how it will pan out. This was not the first STEM related group at the college however, back in 2018, the college had a small group called STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts & Maths). STEAM lasted from 2018 to 2021 and I was fortunate to be within it through its entirety. The first years were very engaging, taking excursions to the Western Sydney University and making multigroup project competitions. A few of these projects included: Programming competitions, Game making, Design competitions, and active projects like making a catapult. The biggest project competition was called the Hawkesbury River PBL, we had to create a digital project which expressed the environmental concerns of the Hawkesbury river. This is what Down The River was for.</p>

    <h2 style="padding-top:50px;">Down The River</h2>
    <p>Our group consisted of Myself, Ricardo, Matthew, Chris, Campbell. After some thought, we decided to make a Unity game. Now for those amongst you who are interested in making a game yourself, I would only recommend Godot 4, back  then it was really the only good option. <br><br>The Unity game was completed, although very bare bones, featuring many physics and texture bugs. The game, thankfully, was in a playable state. I decided to write this article because the game itself was collecting digital dust in my archives and I thought it would be nice to display it here. Below is a video of me running the game on Linux using Wine:</p>

    <p style="padding-top:30px;">It goes without saying that I've seen roblox games with higher visual quality lol. But for a project we made in 2019, I thought it was phenomenal. The sequel, Down The River 2, will be released alongside Half Life 3.</p>
    <h2 style="padding-top:50px;">Conclusions</h2>
    <p style="padding-top:30px;">STEAM and Down The River were integral to my development as a software developer. Personally, I recommend you participate in extracurriculars such as STEAM as they provide a lot of skills. If you are looking for a group such as this one look no further than Mr Merlino and Ms Bakers STEM group. I also decided to reach out to Chris and Campbell to ask for a comment on Down The River's development.</p>
    <p style="padding-top:50px; font-style: italic;">Developing down the river was one of the most fun experiences I have ever had. It put a lot of my experience into perspective and aced as a milestone between what I had learned and what I had yet to learn. Attending Bede polding was and will always be my favourite time of my life. It was a pleasure being there with you. (You were much better than La Salle)</p>

     <p style="padding-top:50px; font-style: italic;">the game development was fun to do, and play sonic adventure 2 on the dreamcast since its an amazing game</p>
